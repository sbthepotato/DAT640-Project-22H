# Datasets

There's nothing to run here but you can look at the DBpedia datasets in the `DBpedia` directory and you can look at the Wikidata datasets in the `Wikidata` directory.

Right now only the DBpedia dataset has been run.

## DBpedia

- `smarttask_dbpedia_test_questions.json` - contains the questions that need to be classified
- `smarttask_dbpedia_test.json` - contains the correct category and type for each question
- `smarttask_dbpedia_train.json` - contains the training dataset
- `smarttask_dbpedia_test_answers_base.json` - contains the category and type predictions from the baseline method
- `smarttask_dbpedia_test_answers_advanced.json` - **#TODO** contains the category and type predictions from the advanced method **#TODO**

## Wikidata

- `lcquad2_anstype_wikidata_test_gold.json` - contains the correct category and type for each question
- `lcdquad2_anstype_wikidata_test.json` - contains the questions that need to be classified
- `lcquad2_anstype_wikidata_train.json` - contains the training dataset
- `wikidata__qid_label.csv` - ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
