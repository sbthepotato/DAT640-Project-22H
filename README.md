# DAT640 Project 2022H Team-001

These are all the files for the project in 'DAT640-Information retrieval and text mining` at UiS in Autumn 2022

## Directory structure

Each directory has its own README files which explains the file structure and how to run it.

- `./advanced` - Contains all the advanced functions and program to run the the DBpedia dataset
- `./analysis` - Contains a Jupyter Notebook which has some basic functions to manually inspect characteristics of the datasets
- `./baseline` - Contains the baseline functions and program to run on the DBpedia dataset
- `./datasets` - Contains all the datasets
- `./evaluate` - Contains the programs to evaluate the results from both the baseline and the advanced method

## [SeMantic AnsweR Type (SMART)](https://smart-task.github.io/) prediction [task 2020](https://smart-task.github.io/2020/)

SMART task is a dataset for the answer type prediction task. Question Answering is a popular task in the field of Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval, in which, the goal is to answer a natural language question (going beyond the document retrieval). Question or answer type classification plays a key role in question answering. The questions can be generally classified based on Wh-terms (Who, What, When, Where, Which, Whom, Whose, Why). Similarly, the answer type classification is determining the type of the expected answer based on the query. Such answer type classifications in literature are performed as a short-text classification task using a set of coarse-grained types, for instance, either 6 or 50 types with TREC QA task. A granular answer type classification is possible with popular Semantic Web ontologies such as DBepdia (~760 classes) and Wikidata (~50K classes).
In this challenge, given a question in natural language, the task is to predict type of the answer using a set of candidates from a target ontology.
