# Evaluation scripts

`dbpedia/` contains the DBpedia evaluation scripts and `wikidata/` contains the Wikidata evaluation scripts. Information on how to run the evaluation can be found within each directory.

**NOTE:** The Wikidata dataset has not been classified so there is nothing of value in that directory.
